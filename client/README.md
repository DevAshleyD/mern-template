# MERN Template Front-End

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Some of the default Create React App source code was removed in order for the user to begin with a clear template.

By default, Create React App runs on port 3000.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the React front-end in the development mode when you are in the client directory.
Default browser opens to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) so you can view changes to your application in real-time.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
